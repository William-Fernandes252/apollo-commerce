# Apollo Commerce Web

The frontend for the test is built with React, Typescript and Material UI. Also, I used Vite as bundler, React Query for data fetching.

## Dependencies

Node: `v19.3.0`

## Run locally

Assuming you have Node.js installed:

- navigate to project frontend folder;
- run

      npm i
      npm run dev

Now the project must be available in your browser.
